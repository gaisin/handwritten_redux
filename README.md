# Handwritten Redux

This is simple redux-like library written to get proper understanding of [redux](https://redux.js.org/).
It has `createStore` which holds `state` and gives `subscribe`, `getState` and `dispatch` functions for working with the state.
Also `createStore` uses a `reducer`, that takes `state` and `action` and gives new value of the state. Same as actual redux works.
App built using [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/), [semantic-ui](https://semantic-ui.com/).
